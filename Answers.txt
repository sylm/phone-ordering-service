-  How would you improve the system?

1. I would add autoscaling and selfhealing to handle peak load like black Friday, or some sales.
2. Service discovery, Eureka or something similar, to manage those autoscaling stuff.
3. Load balancing for same reason from item #1.
4. Config manager like Consul or something similar to get rid of property files and easy change properties on the fly.
5. Service security, we are going to use cloud so to restrict same subnet access we need security. Also we would like to
   have logged in users for loyalty programs etc.
6. Centralized logging on ELK stack. Also if system going to grow, some distributed tracing.

-  How would you avoid your order API to be overflow?

In general it depends on more concrete requirements.
I've already mentioned autoscaling and load balancing, which could help so solve those.
If storage is a bottleneck we could add db sharding.
Also some asyncronous processing could be introduced, depending on requrements it could be just a plain queue, or message bus
or even Kafka.
